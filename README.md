**Abstract:**   
The testicular-hypothalamic-pituitary axis regulates male reproductive system
functions. Understanding these regulatory mechanisms is important for
assessing the reproductive effects of environmental and pharmaceutical
androgenic and antiandrogenic compounds. A mathematical model for the dynamics
of androgenic synthesis, transport, metabolism, and regulation of the adult
rodent ventral prostate was developed on the basis of a model by Barton and
Anderson (1997). The model describes the systemic and local kinetics of
testosterone (T), 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and luteinizing hormone
(LH), with metabolism of T to DHT by 5alpha-reductase in liver and prostate.
Also included are feedback loops for the positive regulation of T synthesis by
LH and negative regulation of LH by T and DHT. The model simulates maintenance
of the prostate as a function of hormone concentrations and androgen receptor
(AR)-mediated signal transduction. The regulatory processes involved in
prostate size and function include cell proliferation, apoptosis, fluid
production, and 5alpha-reductase activity. Each process is controlled through
the occupancy of a representative gene by androgen-AR dimers. The model
simulates prostate dynamics for intact, castrated, and intravenous T-injected
rats. After calibration, the model accurately captures the castration-induced
regression of the prostate compared with experimental data that show that the
prostate regresses to approximately 17 and 5% of its intact weight at 14 and
30 days postcastration, respectively. The model also accurately predicts serum
T and AR levels following castration compared with data. This model provides a
framework for quantifying the kinetics and effects of environmental and
pharmaceutical endocrine active compounds on the prostate.
